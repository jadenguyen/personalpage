Welcome to my personal website! My name is Ngoc Nguyen, I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Boston College (MA, USA).

[My research](http://jadenguyen.github.io/personalpage/1-research.html) focuses on causal inference using observational data, with applications in development and gender economics. I combine theoretical economic modeling with empirical documentation to analyze the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs. I also use reduce-formed methodologies to identify the causal impacts of trade policies on fertility decision and female employment.

I earned my BA in Economics (honors) from Brown University in 2014.
